# for 2022

## Report

Instead of a midterm and final exam, you will write a report instead. This will have several advantages:

- You will have more opportunities to show me what you have been learning.
- I will have more opportunities to give you feedback.
- You will be able to react to my feedback by improving your report.
- You will learn how to use LaTeX to write a professional report.
- You have more freedom to pick one or more topics that interest you.

The report will be divided in two parts (special arrangements are possible):

- Part 1 (50 points, approx 10 pages) will be on Haskell and programming.
- Part 2 (50 points, approx 10 pages) will be on the theoretical aspects of the course.

The [LaTeX template](report.tex) and the compiled [pdf](report.pdf).

**Deadlines:**
- Part 1: October 17.
- Part 2: November 19.
- Part 3: December 21.

Submission by [email](mailto:akurz@chapman.edu?subject=Report%20Part%20X), where X denotes the part. Send me a pdf or a link to your private github repo where you keep your .tex and .pdf as well as the accompanying code of your Haskell project. (Get in touch if you want to do a theory project without Haskell code.)

## General remarks on content

Make the report interesting to a readers including myself. Do not simply repeat material that is already in the lecture notes.  Explore on your own. If you write about material we have covered in the lectures, make your own examples and add your own angle. Your report can build on homework if you integrate them into your own narrative.

## Some Writing Tips

- Typeset code differently from text (eg using `\texttt`).
- Do not always go with the first reference that comes up, try to find interesting references for each topic. Cite your references throughout the text.
- In case of doubt, put rather more references. The basic idea of scientific writing is that all claims must be justified. (Of course, every community has its common knowledge.) 
- In Latex, you can use  `\href` to link to online material.

## Possible Ideas for the Report


To review and explain what we do in the course is a good starting point, but I would expect that you take the opportunity to explore on your own. The following is just a list of prompts to give you some ideas of what is possible ...

***I don't want to limit your creativity, so let me know if you have your own ideas.***


### Haskell
-  Write a Haskell tutorial. Make your own examples that you think would help a beginning Haskeller to understand Haskell better.
- Benchmark the same algorithms in Haskell, Python, etc. You can use [gnomon](https://github.com/paypal/gnomon) to measure the time that programs take to run.
-  I collected some ideas for [Haskell projects](haskell-projects.md) you might want to try.
- Haskell and lambda-calculus: 
  - Write the same program in both languages and compare.
  - Study Church numerals. Make examples. Implement Church numerals and run them in Haskell.
-  If you know C and have experience in programming with pointers, you will be interested to learn that all of this is still in Haskell, but hidden in the compiler. Study how the Haskell compiler makes working with lists efficient. (This is a big topic and would be worth a whole series of blog posts.)
- Write about some features of Haskell that only appear on the sidelines in this course:
    - Haskell is lazy
    - Haskell has type classes
    - Haskell has monads 
- Topics we didn't have time for at all:
    - History of Haskell  
    - Application of Haskell in industry

### Theory

(much of this will make sense only after the first half of the course)

A good starting point would be the homework in the lecture notes. Topics of revelance are (choose some of them):
- **Parsing.** Example topics: Give your own examples of ambiguous and non-ambiguous grammars. Explain, at the hand of an example, how to make a grammart non-ambiguous. Modify the grammar of your calculator by changing precedence levels and explain how different precedence levels correspond to different conventions about which parentheses can be dropped.
- **Lambda Calculus.** Examples: Make your own examples and exercises on variable binding and scope. Show sample reductions that explain how computations with the fixed point combinator or with Church numerals work. Implement Church numerals in Haskell (you need to think about how to print them). What is the type of the Haskell Church numerals? Can you explain them?
- **String Rewriting.** Confluence, normal forms, termination, invariants and exercises. (Recommended.) For more challenges have a look at the Baader-Nipkow book. You could for example take some other proof of the book and treat in the way we have done [here](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/BkNlJ07IY).
- Curry Howard Isomorphism and Type Inference. Take some simple lambda terms and type them. Interpret the types as logical formulas and show that they are tautologies. Conversely, choose some tautologies and find lambda expressions of that type.
- Operational and Denotational Semantics. The lecture on operational semantics contains a number of exercises that could be fun for the mathematically inclined student. Get in touch if you want to do this.
- Theorem Proving. Chapter 2 and 3 of the book [Concrete Semantics](http://concrete-semantics.org/) have a collection of exercises very much in the spirit of this lecture, but they are more challenging than my own homework exercises. This can easily fill Part 2 of the report without the need to tackle another topic.
- **Hoare Logic.** Have a look at the exercises. I can also provide more.

The topics which we looked at in more depth are in boldface. Whatever topics you choose, I want to see that you can solve some concrete exercises and also that you can connect the theory with other aspects of  the course.

Here are some bigger questions that can help you to relate different parts of the course:

- Why is lambda-calculus Turing complete? Why is it normalizing but not terminating?
- What is the halting problem? Why is it undecidable? What are other undecidable problem?
- Some modern programming languages such as [Dafny](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/SJyBbDQjv) implement verification of termination and Hoare triples. Explore.
- [Reversible computing](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/H1PIwnSqw).

And some more advanced questions if you want to explore more:

- What is combinatory logic? Is combinatory logic Turing complete? 
- Beta-reduction is an important computational mechanism. Explore how to efficiently implement it using de Bruin indices.
- Can we prove confluence automatically? What is the Knuth-Bendix algorithm?
- Not all terminating programs can be proved terminating with a termination measure that takes values in natural numbers. How can we go beyond this?
- Interactive theorem provers (Isabelle, Idris, Coq, Agda, Lean, ...) are functional programming languages in which one can prove mathematical theorems. Explore.



#### Other Topics

- Maybe browising through the list of [discussion topics](discussion-topics.md) gives some further ideas.

## Grading Guidelines

Programming Languages is a vast subject. At the core of this course are three interpreters of increasing complexity. They are assessed in three assignments. This is supplemented by some theory on lambda calculus and rewriting. But there are many topics we can only touch upon.  Most obviously, there is much more to Haskell than we strictly need for the course. Similarly, there are many theoretical topics we mention only in passing such as computability, Turing machines, combinatory logic, theorem proving, operational and denotational semantics, type theory, verification etc. 

The overarching rationale for the grading guidelines below is to assess how much you master of the practice of Haskell and the theory of programming languages and how far you engage with some of the ramifications of Programming Languages that go beyond the material of the course.

- **D:** Demonstrates *basic* familiarity with Haskell and the theory of Programming Languages as presented in this course.
- **C:** Demonstrates *adequate* familiarity with Haskell and the theory of Programming Languages as presented in this course. Discusses interesting features of Haskell and illustrates them with their own project. Reviews the theoretical concepts treated in the course and illustrates them with a selection of homework and own examples.
- **B:** Demonstrates *good* understanding of Haskell and the theory of Programming Languages as presented in this course. In addition to the previous item: Develops material that goes beyond what has been treated in class. Can be recommended to next year's students as a learning resource. Makes connections between the practical and theoretical parts of the course. 
- **A:** Demonstrates *excellent* understanding of Haskell and the theory of Programming Languages as presented in this course. Is inspired by the course material but takes an independent perspective and *stands on its own*. Develops material that goes significantly beyond what has been treated in class. Can be highly recommended to next year's students as a learning resource. Makes interesting connections between the practical and theoretical aspects. 

Some further considerations:

- Spelling, typesetting, layout, and structure will also be taken into account for grading. Does the form support the understanding of (or does it distract from) the content? 
- Every section should have something interesting to say and be built around a central idea. If a section reads just like a lists of items without a connecting narrative something is missing.
- A way to describe when a report gets full points: You would be proud to add it to your resume and I would be happy to recommend it to next year's students.
- As usual, for full points I need to be able to see a trail of your work on git (if you don't want to use git get in touch early ... overleaf could be an alternative). 

Again, if you have your own ideas, let me know. I am happy to adapt these guidelines if they do not fit what you have in mind.
