### What we (will) have learned

To clarify the learning outcomes: What we have learned in [Part 0]() and [Part 1](what-we-have-learned-1.md) and [Part 2](what-we-have-learned-2.md) and [Part 3](what-we-have-learned-3.md) and [Part 4](what-we-have-learned-4.md) and [Part 5](what-we-have-learned-5.md) and [Part 6](what-we-have-learned-6.md).

### Part 0: Functional Programming 

- [First Haskell Steps](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/SJgHGZ_nw)

- L 1.1: [What is language?](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/HyvPg4YbK)
- L 1.2: [Imperative vs functional programming](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/SJKWvna6U) and [Recursive programming in Haskell](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/H1jUka4Gv). For a summary on what we said about Haskell watch the [videos](videos.md) entitled [The computational model of functional programming](https://youtu.be/u_OMwv8tDVg) and [Haskell Tips I](https://youtu.be/wj0j2HjMw6w).
- The overarching aim at the moment is to learn how to use [Recursion as a Problem Solving Technique](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/Sy7M_6yMF). Here are some further resources that may help. I made a video on [Euclid's algorithm](https://youtu.be/ZcJMj0antos), often said to be the oldest recursive algorithm known to us. Read Chapter V of [Goedel, Escher, Bach](https://www.physixfan.com/wp-content/files/GEBen.pdf) and make sure to start with the dialogue "Little Harmonic Labyrinth". It is not a coincidence that this dialogue has a similar structure to the one discribed in my note on [Rewriting and the Call Stack](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/HJiulVg0U). A great example of the power of recursion as a problem solving technique is the [Towers of Hanoi](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/rJQwvpyMY).
