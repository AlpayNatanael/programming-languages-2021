### What we (will) have learned

To clarify the learning outcomes: What we have learned in [Part 0]() and [Part 1](what-we-have-learned-1.md) and [Part 2](what-we-have-learned-2.md) and [Part 3](what-we-have-learned-3.md) and [Part 4](what-we-have-learned-4.md) and [Part 5](what-we-have-learned-5.md) and [Part 6](what-we-have-learned-6.md).

### Part 0: Functional Programming 

- [First Haskell Steps](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/SJgHGZ_nw)

- L 1.1: [What is language?](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/HyvPg4YbK)
- L 1.2: [Imperative vs functional programming](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/SJKWvna6U) and [Recursive programming in Haskell](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/H1jUka4Gv). For a summary on what we said about Haskell watch the [videos](videos.md) entitled [The computational model of functional programming](https://youtu.be/u_OMwv8tDVg) and [Haskell Tips I](https://youtu.be/wj0j2HjMw6w).
- The overarching aim at the moment is to learn how to use [Recursion as a Problem Solving Technique](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/Sy7M_6yMF). Here are some further resources that may help. I made a video on [Euclid's algorithm](https://youtu.be/ZcJMj0antos), often said to be the oldest recursive algorithm known to us. Read Chapter V of [Goedel, Escher, Bach](https://www.physixfan.com/wp-content/files/GEBen.pdf) and make sure to start with the dialogue "Little Harmonic Labyrinth". It is not a coincidence that this dialogue has a similar structure to the one discribed in my note on [Rewriting and the Call Stack](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/HJiulVg0U). A great example of the power of recursion as a problem solving technique is the [Towers of Hanoi](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/rJQwvpyMY). 

- L 2.1: Haskell lab. We talked about [Rewriting and the Call Stack](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/HJiulVg0U) and [Towers of Hanoi](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/rJQwvpyMY) as well as the homework. We also talked about [currying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying) and type inference. See the video [Haskell Tips II](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naNLE4GLrTo) for a quick review. For the new homework see [Towers of Hanoi](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/rJQwvpyMY).

- L 2.2: A calculator: [Overview](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/HkpdXJ1fK) and [Interpreter](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/rJX-i1kzY) and [Virtual Machine](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/H12igXkzK). For Haskell programming techniques have a look at the videos [Haskell Tips II](https://youtu.be/naNLE4GLrTo)
and [Recursion over algebraic data types](https://youtu.be/2YLfJvOtLwA).

- Videos: [Order of Operations in CFGs](https://youtu.be/jf1xhZSpCvg) and [Uniqueness of Parse Trees](https://youtu.be/3ZLkPwB_c9g).

- L 3.1: We start with a [Short Introduction to Parsing](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/BkSgRX1GF) and then continue with [A Calculator: Parser](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/Byf812aGF). 

coming up:

- L 3.2: Introducing Assignment 1.

- Video to watch before lecture 4.1: [Syntax of Lambda Calculus](https://youtu.be/D0kH1BpNr14).

- 4.1: [Syntax of Lambda Calculus](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/S1D0yP8Bw) ... video reviews on parsing lambda-calculus expressions:  [one](https://youtu.be/eYstx7uuE6c) and [two](https://youtu.be/yls1NEUlzZA)
