# Report

Instead of a midterm and final exam, I will experiment this year with letting you write a report instead.

I believe that this will have several advantages:
- You will have more opportunities to show me what you have been learning.
- I will have me more opportunities to give you feedback.
- You will be able to react to my feedback by improving your report.
- You will learn how to use LaTeX to write a professional report.

The report will be divided in three parts.

- Part I (40 points, approx 10 pages) will be on Haskell
- Part II (40 points, approx 10 pages) will be on the theoretical aspects of the course.
- Part III (20 points, approx 5 pages) will be a mini-project of your choice where you can go beyond what we do in class.

The [LaTeX template](report.tex) and the compiled [pdf](report.pdf).
